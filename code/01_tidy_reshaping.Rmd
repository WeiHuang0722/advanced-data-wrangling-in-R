This workshop is for students who already have some experience with `dplyr` and `tidyr` and hope to upgrade their data wrangling skills in R.

# Setup

- `pacman` is a great package management tool in R. (For more information, see [the package vignette](http://trinker.github.io/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html).)

- Check your `dplyr` package is up-to-date by typing `packageVersion("dplyr")`. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, then update by typing `update.packages("dplyr")`. You may need to restart R to make it work.

```{r include = FALSE}

# p_load loads and, if necessary, install missing packages.
# install.packages() + library() = p_load()
# If you just want to install, then use p_install()

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # for the tidyverse framework
  here # for computational reproducibility
  )

```

# (Optional) Project-oriented workflow

Read Jenny Bryan's great article on [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/). The key idea is [computatinoal reproduciblity](http://web.stanford.edu/~vcs/talks/Utah2018-STODDEN.pdf). To ensure that, we need to make a project self-contained.

- Almost in all cases, `setwd()` is not reproducible outside the author's local machine. Instead, learn to use `here()`'.
- Do not save .RData when you quit R and don't load. Using [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), add the following line in `.bash_profile`: `alias R='R --no-save --no-restore-data'` (More information on [invoking R](https://colinfay.me/intro-to-r/appendix-b-invoking-r.html) by W. N. Venables and D. M. Smith (R Core Team))

# (Required) Project organization

Read [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html)'s great article on [project management in RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro/).

*Tips for file organization*

- For more information, see ["Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing"](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) by [PLOS](https://plos.org/)

- You can create directories on your computer from R using `dir.create` function.

1. Treat raw data as read only (raw data should be RAW!)

```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("data"))
```

2. Separate read-only data from processed data

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("processed_data"))
```

3. Treat generated outputs as disposable

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("outputs"))
```

4. Separate function definition and application

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("functions"))
```

5. Save the data in the data directory

6. Version control [Using Git from RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio/)

The rest of the workshop follows the basic structure in [the Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) created by RStudio.

# Tidy Data

Many of the following examples draw on [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

> "Tidy data sets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table." - Hadley Wickham

1. Variables -> **Columns**
2. Observations -> **Rows**
3. Values -> **Cells**

A tidy data can be stored in a `data.frame` or [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) object.

![Tidy Data Example (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png)

> "If your data is tidy, element-wise execution will ensure that observations are preserved across functions and operations. Each value will only be paired with other values that appear in the same row of the data frame." - Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham

- Nevertheless, don't be religious.

> In summary, tidy data is a useful conceptual idea and is often the right way to go for general, small data sets, but may not be appropriate for all problems. - Jeff Leek

For instance, in many data science applications, linear algebra-based computations are essential (e.g., [Principal Component Analysis](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~kazdan/312S13/JJ/PCA-JJ.pdf)). These computations are optimized to work on matrices, not tidy data frames. (For more information, read [Jeff Leek's blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/).)


```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

This is what a tidy data looks like.

```{r}

table1

```

**Additional tips**

Packages for importing data:

1. Basic: `readr`
2. SPSS, Stata, and SAS files: `haven`
3. Database: `DBI`
4. json: `jsonlite`
5. Web APIs: `httr`
6. HTML: `rvest`

# Reshape Data

Let's take a look at the cases of untidy data.

![Messy Data Case 1 (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-5.png)

## Make It Longer

- What's the problem with the data?

```{r}

table4a

```
- "1999" and "2000" should not be columns because they are values of a higher-level variable (let's call it "year").

- Let's pivot (rotate by 90 degree). [`pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) increases the number of rows (longer) and decreases the number of columns. The inverse function is `pivot_wider()`. These functions improve the usability of `gather()` and `spread()`.

![What pivot_longer() does (Source: https://www.storybench.org)](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pivot-longer-image.png)

```{r}

# Old way, less intuitive
table4a %>%
  gather(key = "cases", # Current column names
         value = "year", # The values matched to cases
         c("1999", "2000")) # Selected columns

# New way, more intuitive
table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1999", "2000"), # Selected columns
    names_to = "year", # Shorter columns (the columns going to be in one column called year)
    values_to = "cases") # Longer rows (the values are going to be in a separate column called named cases)

```

- There's another problem, did you catch it?

- The data type of `year` variable should be `numeric` not `character`. By default, `pivot_longer()` transforms uninformative columns to character.

- You can fix this problem by using `names_transform` argument.

```{r}

table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1999", "2000"), # Put two columns together
    names_to = "year", # Shorter columns (the columns going to be in one column called year)
    values_to = "cases", # Longer rows (the values are going to be in a separate column called named cases)
    names_transform = list(year = readr::parse_number)
    ) # Transform the column

```

**Additional tips**

A flat file (e.g., CSV) is a rectangular shaped combination of strings. [Parsing](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/vignettes/readr.html) determines the type of each column and turns into a vector of a more specific type. Tidyverse has `parse_` functions (from `readr` package) that are flexible and fast (e.g., `parse_integer()`, `parse_double()`, `parse_logical()`, `parse_datetime()`, `pase_date()`, `parse_time()`, `parse_factor()`, etc).

**Practice**

- Let's do another practice. What's the main problem with this data? (This exercise comes from [`pivot` function vigenette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).)

```{r}

billboard

```

- Too wide. How can you fix it? Which pivot?

```{r}

# Old way
billboard %>%
  gather(key = "week",
         value = "rank",
         starts_with("wk")) %>% # Use regular expressions
  drop_na() # Drop NA values

# New way
billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), # Use regular expressions
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE # Drop NAs
  )

```

- Note that `pivot_longer()` is more versatile than `gather()`.

**Additional tips**

R defines missing values in two ways.

- *Implicit missing values*: simply not present in the data.

- *Explicit missing values*: flagged with NA. This can be dropped (implicit) by adding `values_drop_na = TRUE` in `pivot_longer()`.

```{r}

# pivot_longer can manipulate values when pivoting
billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), # Using regular expressions
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "wk", # Stripping off 'wk'
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE # Dropping NAs
  )

```

**Practice**

Another technique to turn implicit missing values into explicit ones is using `complete()` function.

The following example was inspired by [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51019672/complete-dataframe-with-missing-combinations-of-values).

```{r}

# Toy example

df <- tibble(distance = c(rep("NPR",3), rep(100, 3)),
             years = c(3,4,7,1,5,6),
             area = seq(10, 60, by = 10))

df

```

The data contains some implicit missing values. Can you make them explicit using `complete()` function? (Take a look at the documentation of the function by typing ?complete in the console.)

```{r}

df %>%
  complete(distance,
           years = 1:7) # This is the full list
         #  fill = list(area = 0)) # Fill NAs with 0s

```

## Make It Wider

- What's the problem with the data?

```{r}
table2
```

- Each observation is spread across two rows.
- How can you fix it?: `pivot_wider()`.

**Two differences between `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`**

- In `pivot_longer()`, the arguments are named `names_to` and `values_to` (*to*). In `pivot_wider()`, this pattern is opposite. The arguments are named `names_from` and `values_from` (*from*).

- The number of required arguments for `pivot_longer()` is three (col, names_to, values_to). The number of required arguments for `pivot_wider()` is two (names_from, values_from).

![What pivot_wider() does (Source: https://www.storybench.org)](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pivot-wider-image.png)

```{r}

# Old way
table2 %>%
  spread(key = type,
         value = count)

# New way
table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = type, # first
    values_from = count # second
  )

```

**Practice 1**

Learn to use `pivot_wider()` to make implicit missing values explicit. (We solved the same problem earlier.)

```{r}

df <- tibble(distance = c(rep("NPR",3), rep(100, 3)),
             years = c(3,4,7,1,5,6),
             area = seq(10, 60, by = 10))

df

```

- There are several basic ways to treat missing values in R.

1. Drop NAs: `drop_na(data, ...)`
2. Fill NAs in ... columns with most recent non-NA values: `fill(data, ..., direction = c("down", "up"))`

3. Replace NAs by column: `replace_na(data, replace = list(), ...)`

```{r}

df %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = years,
              values_from = area) %>%
  pivot_longer(2:7, names_to = "years",
               values_to = "area") %>%
  mutate(area = replace_na(area, 0))
# If you want to drop NAs, use `drop_na()`

```

**Practice 2**

- This exercise comes from [`pivot` function vigenette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).

- Could you make `station` a dummy variable (1s = "yes", 0s = "No")?

```{r}
fish_encounters
```

```{r}

fish_encounters %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = station,
  values_from = seen
)

```

- Let's turn NAs into 0s

```{r}
fish_encounters %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = station,
  values_from = seen,
  values_fill = list(seen = 0)
)
```

Like `pivot_longer()`, `pivot_wider()` is also versatile.

- What's the problem with this data?

```{r}

us_rent_income

```

- Generate column name from multiple variables

```{r}
# Old way returns an error
#us_rent_income %>%
 # spread(variable,
  #       c(estimate, moe))

# New way is flexible
us_rent_income %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = variable,
    values_from = c(estimate, moe))

```

## Separate

![Messy Data Case 2 (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-6.png)

```{r}

# Toy example
df <- data.frame(x = c(NA, "Dad.apple", "Mom.orange", "Daughter.banana"))

df

```

```{r}

# Separate
df %>%
  separate(x, into = c("Name", "Preferred_fruit"))

# Don't need the first variable

df %>%
  separate(x, into = c(NA, "Preferred_fruit"))
```

**Practice**

```{r}
table3
```

- Note `sep` argument. You can specify how to separate joined values.

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate,
           into = c("cases", "population"),
           sep = "/")
```

- Note `convert` argument. You can specify whether automatically convert the new values or not.

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate,
           into = c("cases", "population"),
           sep = "/",
           convert = TRUE) # cases and population become integers
```

## Unite

`pivot_longer()` <-> `pivot_wider()`

`separate()` <-> `unite()`

```{r}

# Create a toy example
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Jae", "Sun", "Jane", NA),
  birthmonth = c("April", "April", "June", NA))

# Include missing values
df %>% unite("contact",
             c("name", "birthmonth"))

# Do not include missing values
df %>% unite("contact",
             c("name", "birthmonth"),
             na.rm = TRUE)

```

**Practice**

This example was inspired by a blog post titled ["Compute Correlations Using the Tidyverse"](http://albertotb.com/Compute-correlations-using-the-tidyverse/) written by Alberto Torres Barrán.

- Toy data

```{r}

# For reproducibility
set.seed(1234)

# Toy data
patients <- tibble(date = lubridate::ymd(rep(c(20020101, 20191101, 20200301), each = 3)),
                virus = rep(
                  c("sars", "mers", "covid"), # Vector
                  each = 3), # Each element of the vector will be repeated by the number defined by each argument
                affected = sample(
                  1:20, # Data
                  size = 9, # The number of rows to select
                  replace = TRUE)) # Replacement

```


**Additional tips**

Two ways to create a tibble object.

```{r}
# 1. By columns:

toy1 <- tibble(x = 1:3, y = c("CA", "NY", "TX"))

# 2. By rows:

toy2 <- tribble(~x, ~y,
                      1,  "CA",
                      2,  "NY",
                      3,  "TX",)

# Check
toy1 == toy2

```

- Correlation-matrix

The following code is adapted from [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58837773/pivot-wider-issue-values-in-values-from-are-not-uniquely-identified-output-w).

**Additional tips**

`tibble' package has some great tools to work with row names (for more information, see [this package vigentte](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/rownames.html)).

1. Detect row names: `has_rownames(data)`, `has_rownames(data)`

2. Remove row names: `remove_rownmaes(data)`

3. Convert row names to column: `row_names_to_column(data, var = "new column name") %>% as_tibble()`

4. Add rowid as a column: `rowid_to_column(data)`

```{r}

cor_matrix <-
  patients %>%
    group_by(virus) %>%
    mutate(row = row_number()) %>%  # Without this identifier you will get an error because of the duplicate rows
    pivot_wider(names_from = virus,
                values_from = affected,
                values_fill = list(affected = 0)) %>%
    select(-c("row", "date")) %>%
    cor() # Calculate correlations

cor_matrix
```

- Could you turn the correlation matrix into a tidy dataframe?

```{r}

cor_matrix %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% # Don't use tibble()
  rownames_to_column(var = "virus1") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -virus1,
               names_to = "virus2",
               values_to = "corr")

```

# Represent Data 

## Arrange

- Order rows

```{r}

dplyr::arrange(mtcars, mpg) # Low to High (default)

dplyr::arrange(mtcars, desc(mpg)) # High to Row

```

## Rename

- Rename columns

```{r}

df <- tibble(y = c(2011, 2012, 2013))

df

df %>% rename(Year = # OLD name
                y) # NEW name

```
